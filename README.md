DelayQueue is a message queue supporting delayed/scheduled delivery based on redis.

Core Advantages:

- Support ACK/Retry mechanism, it will re-deliver message after a while as long as no confirmation is received. As long as Redis doesn't crash, consumer crashes won't cause message loss.
- Works safely in a distributed environment, you could deliver message to same queue or consume message from same queue at multiple machines.
- A message will be consumed by one and only one consumer.
- Consumers control the flow of messages, NO NEED FOR ANY OTHER MIDDLEWARES except redis.

## Install

DelayQueue requires a Go version with modules support. Run following command line in your project with go.mod:

```
go get github.com/hdt3213/delayqueue
```

## Get Started

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/go-redis/redis/v9"
	"github.com/hdt3213/delayqueue"
	"strconv"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	redisCli := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
		Addr: "127.0.0.1:6379",
	})
	queue := delayqueue.NewQueue("example", redisCli, func(payload string) bool {
		// callback returns true to confirm successful consumption.
		// If callback returns false or not return within maxConsumeDuration, DelayQueue will re-deliver this message
		return true
	}).WithConcurrent(4) // set the number of concurrent consumers 
	// send delay message
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		err := queue.SendDelayMsg(strconv.Itoa(i), time.Hour, delayqueue.WithRetryCount(3))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
	// send schedule message
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		err := queue.SendScheduleMsg(strconv.Itoa(i), time.Now().Add(time.Hour))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
	// start consume
	done := queue.StartConsume()
	<-done
}
```

## Options

```go
WithLogger(logger *log.Logger)
```

WithLogger customizes logger for queue


```go
WithConcurrent(c uint) 
```

WithConcurrent sets the number of concurrent consumers

```go
WithFetchInterval(d time.Duration)
```

WithFetchInterval customizes the interval at which consumer fetch message from redis

```go
WithMaxConsumeDuration(d time.Duration)
```

WithMaxConsumeDuration customizes max consume duration

If no acknowledge received within WithMaxConsumeDuration after message delivery, DelayQueue will try to deliver this
message again

```go
WithFetchLimit(limit uint)
```

WithFetchLimit limits the max number of unack (processing) messages

```go
UseHashTagKey()
```

UseHashTagKey add hashtags to redis keys to ensure all keys of this queue are allocated in the same hash slot.

If you are using Codis/AliyunRedisCluster/TencentCloudRedisCluster, you should add this option to NewQueue: `NewQueue("test", redisCli, cb, UseHashTagKey())`. This Option cannot be changed after DelayQueue has been created.

WARNING! CHANGING(add or remove) this option will cause DelayQueue failing to read existed data in redis

> see more:  https://redis.io/docs/reference/cluster-spec/#hash-tags

```go
WithDefaultRetryCount(count uint)
```

WithDefaultRetryCount customizes the max number of retry, it effects of messages in this queue

use WithRetryCount during DelayQueue.SendScheduleMsg or DelayQueue.SendDelayMsg to specific retry count of particular message

# More Details

Here is the complete flowchart:

![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/09/10/tziHmcAX4sFJPN6.png)

- pending: A sorted set of messages pending for delivery. `member` is message id, `score` is delivery unix timestamp.
- ready: A list of messages ready to deliver. Workers fetch messages from here.
- unack: A sorted set of messages waiting for ack (successfully consumed confirmation) which means the messages here is being processing. `member` is message id, `score` is the unix timestamp of processing deadline.
- retry: A list of messages which processing exceeded deadline and waits for retry
- garbage: A list of messages reaching max retry count and waits for cleaning
